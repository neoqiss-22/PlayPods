# PlayPods Architecture

## Overview
PlayPods is built with React Native using a scalable, modular architecture.

## Key Principles
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components are designed to be reusable
3. **Testability**: Code is structured to be easily testable
4. **Scalability**: Architecture supports growth and team expansion

## Structure
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components
- `src/screens/`: Screen-level components
- `src/services/`: Business logic and API calls
- `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks
- `src/utils/`: Utility functions and constants

## State Management
We use React Context for global state management, with the option to migrate to Redux/Zustand as the app grows.

## Navigation
React Navigation v6 with stack and tab navigators.
