# PlayPods - Video Content Platform

A modern, dark-themed video content platform built with **native Android (Java/Kotlin)** and **native iOS (Swift/UIKit)**, with some basic screens implemented in React Native and TypeScript. PlayPods provides a YouTube-like experience with a focus on clean design and excellent user experience.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Structure

The app follows a **PhD-level engineering approach** with proper separation of concerns, implementing most UI screens in **native code**:
