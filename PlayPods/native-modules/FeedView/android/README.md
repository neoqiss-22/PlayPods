Android FeedView stub

Place Android implementation files here. Recommended implementation:
- Implement a `FeedView` class that extends `ViewGroup` or `FrameLayout` and hosts a RecyclerView.
- Use ExoPlayer instances from a shared player pool.
- Expose the view to React Native by creating a `FeedViewManager` (extends SimpleViewManager) and registering it.

Example files to add:
- FeedView.java
- FeedViewManager.java
- PlayerPool.java
